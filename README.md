We believe public policy should be decided using the best available evidence.

#### BitTorrent database

A server-less searchable database using <a href=https://github.com/webtorrent/webtorrent>WebTorrent</a>. This database is a current and historical record of torrents shared over BitTorrent. Anyone can download, share, and use this database freely.
