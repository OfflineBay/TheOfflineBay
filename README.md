### <a href=https://theofflinebay.org>theofflinebay.org</a>

<a href=https://theofflinebay.org>The Offline Bay</a> is an online version of our to-be-released book. Below are our principles. 

#### Pirate Politics

We support e-democracy, information privacy, free speech, civil rights, transparency, copyright and patent law reform, anti-corruption, and the free sharing of knowledge.

#### Evidence Informed Policy

We believe public policy should be decided using the best available evidence.

#### Kopimism

* All knowledge to all
* The search for knowledge is sacred
* The circulation of knowledge is sacred
* The act of copying is sacred

#### BitTorrent Search

A decentralized BitTorrent database for anyone to search, download, share, and use freely. It contains most alive torrents shared over BitTorrent.

We are in early development and open to any suggestions through the issues tab. Help with our CSS would be highly appreciated.
